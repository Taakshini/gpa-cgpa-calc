    <pre>Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
        Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling?
        If you can't catch me, darling
        Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
        A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
        Can't hold me close, baby
        I want you to know that I'm never leaving
        'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
        Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
        So come on, let's go
        Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
        I love you forever where we'll have some fun
        Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
        Please, don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby
        My snowman and me
        My snowman and me
        Baby
        Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
        Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
        Without legs to run, honey
        Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
        Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
        If you don't have ears, baby
        I want you to know that I'm never leaving
        'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
        Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
        So come on, let's go
        Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
        I love you forever where we'll have some fun
        Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
        Please, don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby
        My snowman and me
        My snowman and me
        Baby</pre>
